# How to Upgrade DBR-JS from v10.x to v11.x

## Change the way to reference the SDK

In version 10.0.21 and earlier versions, you may need to reference several modules:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-core@3.0.20/dist/core.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-license@3.0.20/dist/license.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-utility@1.0.20/dist/utility.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-barcode-reader@10.0.20/dist/dbr.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-capture-vision-router@2.0.20/dist/cvr.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-camera-enhancer@4.0.1/dist/dce.js"></script>
```

For versions after 10.0.21 but before 11.x, you only need to update the version number of `dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle`.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle@11.0.3000/dist/dbr.bundle.js"></script>
```

## APIs changes introduced in v11.0.3000

### BarcodeScanner API Changes

Several properties have been renamed or had their default values changed. Please review the table below and update your implementation accordingly if you rely on the previous defaults.

| Property                                | Old Default | New Default | Notes                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `removePoweredByMessage` *(deprecated)* | `false`     | —           | Replaced by `showPoweredByDynamsoft`                           |
| `showPoweredByDynamsoft`                | `false`     | `true`      | Controls whether the "Powered by Dynamsoft" label is displayed |
| `showCloseButton`                       | `false`     | `true`      | Controls whether the close button is shown in the scannerView  |
| `showResultView`                        | `false`     | `true`      | Controls whether the result view is shown                      |

> [!NOTE]
> If your project depends on the previous default behavior, you must explicitly set these properties to maintain compatibility.

### Foundational API Changes

#### loadWasm() Simplified

The loadWasm() function no longer requires any parameters. Simply call loadWasm() without arguments.

```javascript
Dynamsoft.Core.CoreModule.loadWasm();
```

#### engineResourcePaths Simplified

There is no longer a need to define `engineResourcePaths` for different modules. Resource management has been centralized and streamlined.

```javascript
// To specify the path for rootDirectory
Dynamsoft.Core.CoreModule.engineResourcePaths.rootDirectory = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/";
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remove unnecessary parameters from `loadWasm()` calls.
> 
> Eliminate any redundant configuration of `engineResourcePaths`.

### Upgrade your template

The template system is upgraded. The template you used for the previous version can’t be directly recognized by the new version. Please use the [template upgrade tool](https://www.dynamsoft.com/tools/template-upgrade/) to upgrade your template.

## From version 9.x or earlier

The Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript edition has been refactored to integrate with DynamsoftCaptureVision (DCV) architecture since version 10. To understand the advantages of this new architecture, please refer to these resources:

* [Overview of Dynamsoft Capture Vision](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/introduction/)
* [Dynamsoft Capture Vision Framework Details](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/architecture/)

Additionally, it's important to note that Dynamsoft's ongoing enhancements will be based on this updated architecture. By upgrading to version 11, you will gain access to the latest features and enhanced performance.

Due to these significant changes, a substantial rewrite of your existing code will be necessary to transition to the new version. we recommend you to follow the [User Guide](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/user-guide/barcode-scanner.html) and re-write your codes.
