<div class="fold-panel-prefix"></div>

### Version Highlights <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>

<div class="fold-panel-start"></div>

- **DotCode** decoding is improved by optimizing the localization of DotCodes that are close to one another.
- **EAN8 barcode** decoding is improved by honing the accuracy of localization algorithms.
- **QR code** localizing is improved by reducing the mis-assemble rate of the finder patterns when using the localization mode LM_CONNECTED_BLOCK or LM_SCAN_DIRECTLY, which are designed for speed. The mis-assembling only occurs when there exist dense QR codes on the same image.
- **Mirrored rectangular DataMatrix barcode** is supported by implementing `MirrorMode` when localizing the barcodes.
- Deformed barcode decoding is improved by extending the supported modes and mode arguments of `DeformationResistingModes`.

<div class="fold-panel-end"></div>

### Edition-Specific Highlights

#### Added

- Added 3 new properties in [`ScanSettings`](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/interface/ScanSettings.html#scansettings)
  1. `autoZoom`, when set to `true`, means the SDK will automatically zoom in on the video if the barcode appears too small in the video feed and fails to be read;
  2. `autoFocus`, when set to `true`, means the SDK will automatically focus on the part of the video where a barcode is found but fails to be read;
  3. `autoSuggestTip`, when set to `true`, means the SDK will automatically suggest Tip messages to help guide the user to acquire better video frames for barcode reading.

> These features are only valid when there is a intermediate_results module license.

#### Changed

- `duplicateForgetTime` can only be set to a maximum of 10 seconds in this version. It was not limited in previous versions.

#### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where binary intermediate result images had unwanted black borders.

## 9.3.1 (10/10/2022)

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where calling `setCurrentCamera()` or `setResolution()` before opening the camera would cause an error.
* Fixed a bug where the canvas used internally remains in the DOM and is not removed as expected after a `BarcodeScanner` instances calls `destroyContext()`.

## 9.3.0 (09/27/2022)

### Added

* Added 3 properties to control the highlight style of linear barcodes before validation.
  * `barcodeFillStyleBeforeVerification`
  * `barcodeStrokeStyleBeforeVerification`
  * `barcodeLineWidthBeforeVerification`

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where linear barcodes found were highlighted with a beep (if sound was enabled) but no results were output.

## 9.2.13 (08/11/2022)

* Fixed bugs with the properties `barcodeFillStyle`,`barcodeStrokeStyle` and `barcodeLineWidth` to make them work properly.
* Fixed a bug with `onFrameRead` so that it fires regardless of whether there is a result on the processed frame (as expected).
* Fixed a bug with `onImageRead` so that it fires only once for the same image (as expected), instead of twice.

## 9.2.12 (08/04/2022)

* Fixed a bug where the scan region mask and/or other shapes drawn on the UI were not updated when the view changed to landscape from portrait or vice versa on mobile devices.
* This version uses [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer version 3.0.1](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs-archive/web/programming/javascript/release-note/release-notes-3.x.html?ver=latest#301-08042022).

## 9.2.11 (07/28/2022)

### Added

* Added option `captureAndDecodeInParallel` to the interface `ScanSettings` to control whether to speed up the decoding by capturing the next frame in advance.
* Added properties `ifSaveLastUsedCamera` and `ifSkipCameraInspection` for better camera control.
* Added two more templates `dense` and `distance` as options for `updateRuntimeSettings()`.

### Changed

* The default resolution to try for cameras on desktop is changed to 1920 x 1080, previously it was 1280 x 720.
* The method `setImageSource()` now takes an additional parameter `options` which helps to pass the information needed by the `BarcodeReader` object, such as the definition (`Dynamsoft.DCE.DrawingItem`) for creating the shapes that highlight barcodes.
* When reading 1D barcodes, the callback `onFrameRead` now verifies a result across multiple frames before outputting it so that it is more reliable. The same logic was always used for the callback `onUniqueRead`.
* The methods `pauseScan()` (for `BarcodeScanner`) and `pauseScanning()` (for `BarcodeReader`) now both accept an optional parameter `options`, which can control the behavior of the pause, such as whether to keep results highlighted (`keepResultsHighlighted`).
* This version uses [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer version 3.0.0](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs-archive/web/programming/javascript/release-note/release-notes-3.x.html#300-07272022) instead of the previous version 2.3.2.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where the intermediate result images are redacted even with a valid license.

## 9.0.2 (05/06/2022)

### Added

* Added API `ifShowScanRegionMask` to `BarcodeScanner` to control whether to show the scan region mask.

### Changed

* Moved the following docs from the doc directory to the root directory of the package.
  * `Api Reference.html`
  * `legal.txt`
  * `License Agreement.html`

### Fixed

* Fixed bugs with `regionMaskFillStyle`, `regionMaskStrokeStyle`, `regionMaskLineWidth` of `BarcodeScanner` to avoid invalid value setting.
* Fixed a bug where region will be reset to full image when switching template after region setting of `BarcodeScanner`.
* Fixed a bug where the region setting is invalid when using `updateRuntimeSettings` of `BarcodeReader`.

## 9.0.1 (04/25/2022)

### Added

* Added method `setVideoFit()` to `BarcodeScanner` to allow the video element to either fit or cover the viewer.
* Added method `setImageSource()` to `BarcodeReader` to specify an Image Source which provides images of the type [`DSImage`](../api-reference/interface/dsimage.md) for continuous scanning.
* Added methods `startScanning()`, `pauseScanning()`, `resumeScanning()`, `stopScanning()`, `getScanSettings()` and `updateScanSettings()` as well as events `onUniqueRead` and `onImageRead` to `BarcodeReader` to facilitate continous scanning of images coming from the Image Source.

## 9.0.0 (03/24/2022)

<div class="fold-panel-prefix"></div>

### Version Highlights <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>

<div class="fold-panel-start"></div>

* Simplified the license activation steps. Different license activation APIs are integrated into one API.
* Added support for **Pharmacode**.
* Added support for **Code 11**, an 1D format.
* Deformation resisting modes `DRM_BROAD_WARP`, `DRM_LOCAL_REFERENCE` and `DRM_DEWRINKLE` are optimized and detached from `DRM_GENERAL`. Users can specify a more effective deformation resisting mode when processing **QRCode** and **DataMatrix codes**.
* Optimized the confidence scoring system for **PDF417 codes**.

<div class="fold-panel-end"></div>

### Edition-Specific Highlights

#### Added

* Added the property `license` as the main API for setting a license key.
* Added methods `getFocus()` and `setFocus()` to control the camera focus.
