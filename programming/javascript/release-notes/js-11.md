# Release Notes for Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK

## 11.0.6000 (08/14/2025)

### New

- Introduced new samples:

  - [`Pick One to Fill`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/barcode-scanner-api-samples/scan-single-barcode/pick-one-to-fill/index.html) - [run竊余(https://demo.dynamsoft.com/samples/dbr/js/barcode-scanner-api-samples/scan-single-barcode/pick-one-to-fill/index.html?utm_source=sampleReadme): Pick one and auto-fill fields by simply opening the camera and scanning a group of barcodes.
  - [`Use Customized Template`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/barcode-scanner-api-samples/scan-single-barcode/use-customized-template/index.html) - [run竊余(https://demo.dynamsoft.com/samples/dbr/js/barcode-scanner-api-samples/scan-single-barcode/use-customized-template/index.html?utm_source=sampleReadme): Use different customized templates for scanning various barcode types.
  - [`Batch Inventory`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/blob/main/barcode-scanner-api-samples/scan-multiple-barcodes/batch-inventory/index.html) - [run竊余(https://demo.dynamsoft.com/samples/dbr/js/barcode-scanner-api-samples/scan-multiple-barcodes/batch-inventory/index.html?utm_source=sampleReadme): An inventory management tool scan barcodes in batches and provide real-time analysis of the scanned data.
  - [`Read and Parse GS1-AI`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/foundational-api-samples/use-case/read-and-parse-GS1-AI/index.html) - [run竊余(https://demo.dynamsoft.com/samples/dbr/js/foundational-api-samples/use-case/read-and-parse-GS1-AI/index.html?utm_source=sampleReadme): Read GS1 Application Identifier (AI) barcode and parse its structured data.

- Template Version Validation: Introduced version checking for templates to prevent compatibility issues and mismatches.

### Changed

- License Validation Behavior: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An warning is still reported to indicate the license issue.

### Fixed

- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 11.0.3000 (07/09/2025)

### [Highlights](https://www.dynamsoft.com/release-highlights/?product=dcv3.0)

#### Workflow Improvements

- Restructured the parameter control hierarchy at all levels for finer scope definition and more granular process management, with the stage level newly added.
  
#### Deep Learning Integration

- Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.

#### Algorithm Enhancements

- Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
- Improved the `CODE_128` and `DataMatrix` DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
- Added support for new barcode types: `CODE_32`, `MATRIX_25`, `KIX`, and `TELEPEN`.
- Added GS1 Application Identifiers (AI) support for improved code parsing capabilities.

#### Engineering Optimizations

- Simplified the loading and configuration of WASM resources, reducing the overall size of the WASM files.

#### Updates for [BarcodeScanner](https://dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/api-reference/barcode-scanner.html)

- Updated default values for certain parameters:
  - The close button is now shown by default.
  - The `resultView` is now shown by default for `multi_unique` mode.
- Improved deduplication and billing logic for more accurate count tracking.
- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.
