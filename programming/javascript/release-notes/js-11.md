# Release Notes for Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK

### [Highlights](https://www.dynamsoft.com/release-highlights/?product=dcv3.0)

#### Workflow Improvements

- Restructured the parameter control hierarchy at all levels for finer scope definition and more granular process management, with the stage level newly added.
- Enabled custom combinations and sequences of sections, increasing flexibility and operational customization under specific conditions.
  
#### Deep Learning Integration

- Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.

#### Algorithm Enhancements

- Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
- Enhanced the text recognition workflow by integrating improved multi-step recognition processes and validation methods.
- Improved the `CODE_128` and `DataMatrix` DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
- Added support for new barcode types: `CODE_32`, `MATRIX_25`, `KIX`, and `TELEPEN`.
- Added GS1 Application Identifiers (AI) support for improved code parsing capabilities.

#### Engineering Optimizations

- Simplified the loading and configuration of WASM resources, reducing the overall size of the WASM files.
