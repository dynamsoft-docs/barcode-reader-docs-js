# Read the PDF417 Barcode on the Driver's License

The PDF417 barcode on an AAMVA compatible driver's license contains a lot of information which is encoded following the DL/ID Card Design Standard. Together with a simple parse function, we can use the sdk to read and get the information to be used in our workflow.

The following official sample shows how to use the sdk to read a driver's license and extract its information.
