# How to Upgrade

## From version 7.2.2-v2 and above

If you are using a **CDN**, simply update the version number denoted after **@** in the URL.

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode@7.6.0/dist/dbr.js" data-productKeys="PRODUCT-KEYS"></script>
   ```

If you have deployed the library files on your own server, you'll need to replace the old files with the ones in the latest version. Download the latest version [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Downloads/Dynamic-Barcode-Reader-Download.aspx).

## From version 7.2.2-v2 or below

Some major changes were made in version 7.2.2-v2 and will require existing code updates in your application.

Follow the detailed guide in [this post](https://www.dynamsoft.com/blog/announcement/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-sdk-for-javascript-upgrade-from-v7-1-3-to-v7-2-2/) for upgrade steps.
