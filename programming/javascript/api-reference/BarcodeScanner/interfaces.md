# Javascript API Reference - `BarcodeScanner` Interfaces

| Interface            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| [FrameFilter](#framefilter) | Filter and discard video frames while focusing. |
| [ScannerPlayCallbackInfo](#scannerplaycallbackinfo) | Stores the height and width constraints of the video stream. |
| [ScanSettings](#scansettings) | Configures the video stream settings. |
| [VideoDeviceInfo](#videodeviceinfo) | Stores the video device information. |

<!--
## FrameFilter

Filter and discard video frames that are out of focus during the scanning operation.

### Properties

| Property         | Type | Default Value | Description |
|------------------|------|---------------|-------------|
| region<sub>optional</sub> | [Region](#region) | <pre>{ regionLeft = 0, <br/>regionRight = 100, <br/>regionTop = 0, <br/>regionBottom = 100, <br/>regionMeasuredByPercentage = true }</pre> | Detecting area of a frame. | 
| threshold<sub>optional</sub> | *number* | `0.1` | Threshold used for filtering images. <br>Value range: [0, 1]. <br>An indicator is calculated for each frame from `AppendFrame()`. If the change rate of the indicators between the current frame and historic frames is larger than this threshold, the current frame will be discarded. |
