`interface` LocalizationResult

* transformationMatrix: *Array<number>*

  > A transformation matrix that can transform the coordinates of the four resultPoints so that they show up correctly on the displayed image.

* angle: *number*

  > The angle of a barcode. Values range from 0 to 360.

* x1: *number*

  > The X coordinate of the left-most point.

* x2: *number*

  > The X coordinate of the second point in a clockwise direction.

* x3: *number*

  > The X coordinate of the third point in a clockwise direction.

* x4: *number*

  > The X coordinate of the fourth point in a clockwise direction.

* y1: *number*

  > The Y coordinate of the left-most point.

* y2: *number*

  > The Y coordinate of the second point in a clockwise direction.

* y3: *number*

  > The Y coordinate of the third point in a clockwise direction.

* y4: *number*

  > The Y coordinate of the fourth point in a clockwise direction.

* confidence: *number*

  > The confidence, or accuracy, of the localization result.

* resultCoordinateType: *number*

  > Determines whether the coordinates of a located barcode (x1,x2,x3,etc.) are shared as pixel coordinates or as percentages of the total dimensions of the image or frame. To learn more, please refer to [EnumResultCoordinateType](../enum/EnumResultCoordinateType.md).
